Google Maps SDK for iOS 6 v1.2.0.2863 with Storyboards and OpenGL view on top of maps

Description
------------
This example project demonstrates how to use Google Maps SDK and additionally stack your own OpenGL view on top of the maps.
OpenGL uses GLKit and draws a simple textured square.

Currently Orthogonal projection is setup with drawing matrix (0,0, screen.width, screen.height) so CGPoints from Google Maps can directly be projected to CGPoints on OpenGL surface.
 

Reusable view
--------------
Included also custom reusable subview with buttons
